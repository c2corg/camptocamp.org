It is currently restricted to steep trails that are graded at least 4.1. You can see that the results are often correct, and are consistent with the ratings already well established of some classic routes, particularly those with a long slope and precise gradient. For shorter slopes typical in the Belldonne region, the skiability difficult achieves the expected rating."
